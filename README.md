uMF: micro modelling framework (uMF)
====================================

uMF is a minimal, yet powerful modeling framework for the Lua
language. It permits defining and validating models by means of
placing structural, composable contraints on Lua tables.


Simple Example
--------------

A constraint is model using a umf `Spec`. Multiple predefined specs
are available.

To model a 3D vector of the form ``{ x=1, y=0, z=0 }`` can be achieved
with the following Spec:

```Lua
Vector3DSpec = umf.TableSpec{
   name = 'Vector3D',
   sealed = 'both',
   dict = {
      x = umf.NumberSpec{},
      y = umf.NumberSpec{},
      z = umf.NumberSpec{},
   },
   optional={},
}
```

Further documentation will follow shortly. For now check out the
examples in the `test/` subdirectory.
